# Guided Filtering
Guided Filtering is one of three proposed method used for Denoisng 3D LIDAR data. 

Guided Filtering is a filtering technique which uses a guidance image (I) to improve the clarity of the input image. Guided Filtering is quite versatile since as an edge preserving smoothing process it does not suffer from artifacts near the edges. 

In the case of Task-Based Adaptive Sampling, objects detected provide ROI’s which are scanned at a higher rate than areas out with the ROI’s, providing a more focussed sampling of the scene compared to unform or random sampling.
